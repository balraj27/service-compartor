# service-compartor
This project is in golang to compare service responses from two different versions.

e.g. Let us assume, service "shedules" is in production with stable version v1. 
If you are goning to release new version v2. Then, this tool will help you identify differences by making request to service against v1 and v2.
This will generate reports on newly added, deleted or edit fields.
